<h3 id="1">Childhood</h3>

<p> <img id= "pic1" src="images/dog.jpg"></img>
I am happy to share a bit about my life and background. My personal history begins on another 
continent,  I was born in Shanghai, China, but I came to America when my family and I decided 
to move for a job opportunity just around the time I was entering kindergarten. Both of my
parents attended universities back in China before we moved here, but I plan on studying here in America,
which they both encourage and help me with. Right now, I'm a junior attending 
<a href="https://my.sduhsd.net" target="_blank">Canyon Crest Academy</a>, and the main field I am 
interested in is STEM based activities, but I also think subjects like art and history are interesting. 
My favorite family member is my sweet boy, Dodo, a chihuahua mix I adopted from Helen Woodward 
Animal Shelter when I was in the seventh grade, and who is now celebrating his 
fifth birthday in April. I also absolutely adore my little sister, <span class = "highlight">who is currently eight years old 
and in the third grade at Solana Ranch.</span> There’s a significant seven-and-a-half-year age gap 
between us, but it just makes our relationship all the more special.</p>

<h3 id="2">Likes and Dislikes</h3>

<p> <img id="pic2" src="images/stitch.png"></img>I love animals, both in the wild and as domestic pets, and I always want to adopt 
more animals into my household which my parents don't always support. I've previously kept
a wide range of pets, including rodents and birds. I’ve previously had a hamster named Baby
and <span class="highlight">three guinea pigs called Coco, Lele, and Baobao.</span> I even raised three pet chickens from 
newborn chicks to healthy hens. I’ve wished for a cat ever since my elementary school days, 
and I also really want to adopt a pet reptile. I think snakes are gorgeous creatures that 
look like living jewels, although I do agree that they are intimidating. If I could do more
research, I definently hope to own a snake in the future. My favorite color is green but 
I don't own much green things. I like darker shades of forest green and also paler ones.
While I definitely try to steer clear of early mornings, loud screaming, most sports
super hot weather, and intense fast cardio exercise, I love windy and cloudy weather, 
especially with a light breeze but not freezing cold. I also love watching people dance or
participate in drag, I think their movements are elegant and beautiful. 
To top it all off, my favorite cartoon is Lilo and Stitch, and my favorite character
in it is

<h3 id="3">Hobbies</h3>

<p><img id="pic3" src="images/elephant.png"></img>I truly love engaging in a broad range of creative and relaxing pursuits, and I'm always 
looking for new things to capture my attention. I’ve gained practical experience with fun 
tactile crafts like sewing and crocheting, which allowed me to create several charming 
stuffed animals and even cute 
<a href="https://sockmonkeyoracle.com/how-to-make-a-sock-monkey/" target="_blank">sock monkeys</a>. 
I’m also an active collector, happily building up my collections of both figures and variousadorable 
stuffed animals. When I really need to unwind and relax, I enjoy low-key activities like listening 
to music, reading books, and, yes, taking frequent naps—I love a good nap! I keep moving, too, 
enjoying gentle physical activity like hiking, and I always bring my amazing dog along for 
those excursions. Historically, my interests included engaging in games and the traditional 
Japanese paper folding art of origami. But the absolute biggest passion of my life is my profound 
love for food, which is why <span class="highlight">my ultimate life goal is to travel extensively around the world</span> just so 
I can sample all the amazing cuisines from diverse cultures!</p>
